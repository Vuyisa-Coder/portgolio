        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <p>My name is Vuyisa Yengeni I born in 1990 in the former Transkei in a small town by the name of Butterworth which lies midway between Umtata and East London. There wasn’t much from where we were raised a little toddlers however at about 5 years my love for soccer was noted and I subsequently played soccer and I was very remarkable from my peers and my dreams was to make it professional. I started school at a pre-school called Butterworth educare centre and started my first grade the following at St Theresa both these schools were at my home town. It was the love for books and sports that came first to me and as a young kid that was very hard to balance however that is where my mom came to the part to keep me disciplined and focused in all that needed my focus at that time.
          In 2001 I moved to Komga a town smaller than the one was from however their education was said to be better than from where I was born and in a much I just wanted to be the footballer my mom wanted me to have better education than she did. The challenges at this school were pretty much different and the first one was to learn being independent. The other challenge was to learn Afrikaans which I would regard as the hardest challenge at that time.  I knew I had to put more time to overcome that and that was no choice as the corporal punish was still the thing back then but to do nothing but to push myself so I could overcome that challenge and the first thing was to learn the basics of the language to make my life easier at that school . As more missing home that’s when I realized that time is the only remedy for that as I got used to the new school. I stayed at this school for 5 years and on the 5th year I was elected as a school prefect and the in the top 10 performers in my grade and the best performer in HSS. I also represented my school Morgenster in this first team of each and every level that I played.<br><br><br>
          In 2006 I moved back to my hometown to complete my senior secondary studies and at this I fascinated about Maths and Science and I took that stream. I was not sure about which career path to follow. I did a little research about that career path to take and I shortlisted just a few courses and IT was not part of them as there was a stigma behind it that said there were job scarcity in the field not knowing that it is a broad industry with a lot of branches within it. I then decided to go for Geology because when you from a disadvantaged background you don’t just look for what you love but what will assist you in putting the food on the table as well. 
            In high school there challenges were just the level of being busy and also being told all the scary stories about university. I soon completed in 2009 and headed straight to University. I moved to Cape Town in 2010 and all was bliss and full of excitement and all of the possibilities I was told about. All I wanted was to study however the very first challenge was travelling over 100 KM only to find out that you mistakenly never applied for the residence but only for the studies. Luckily even I knew someone from back however we were given the temporary rooms for the time that we didn’t have the rooms. I classes had also started with no place to return to after each day but to go to the  residence administration to be assigned a room for the night and tomorrow was another struggle. Many of the people I was with were assigned rooms and I was never successful and ended up finding a place to stay in the close by neighbourhood. Studying while not staying in campus something that which was not easy at times you would miss a train or the train would delay to an exam of a very important lesson. That alone was something that made life more difficult and all at this time I didn’t realize the love for the tech and I wasn’t feeling my course very much. I completed my degree in 5 years instead of three years after failing my major subject twice. Soon after the completion of my degree I got a job as a sales agent at Old Mutual and after that I worked as a general worker at some factory in Epping before starting to work as a contact centre agent. It was a midst of these times that I realized my love for tech and which mostly was influenced by people in my circles however procrastination and the fear to have a gap in the salary was my fear I too longer to respond to that. 
            In 2020 Jan I started my journey at CapaCiTi as a trainee in Systems Development. My first introduction was introduction to python and then an introduction to Java, MYSQL database. Gaining knowledge in these languages have assisted me in seeing every application differently which just injected more interest on what I do and more ideas on how to perform certain tasks. I have then pushed myself to have more knowledge to knowing more on the frontend work as well so I can put on  display something that would make things easy more me and that would make things easier for the users as well. You tend to have ideas beyond this world and try to bring them into existence by applying what you know. I am now in the process of making my mark in the industry and getting myself deep into the industry by even learning more and doing even greater. </span>
